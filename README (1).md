![Task 5](task5_question.PNG.png)
In this task, I analyzed U.S. traffic accident data to uncover patterns related to weather, road conditions, and time of day. The goal was to identify accident hotspots and understand contributing factors to improve road safety.

Explored the correlation between accidents and environmental factors. Visualized trends to detect peak accident times, high-risk weather types, and locations with recurring incidents.
